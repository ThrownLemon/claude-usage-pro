**Claude Usage Pro** is a native macOS menu bar application that helps you monitor your Claude.ai API usage across multiple accounts in real-time. Stay on top of your session and weekly usage limits with beautiful visual gauges that change color as you approach your limits.

Whether you're managing a single Claude account or juggling multiple accounts across different organizations, Claude Usage Pro provides an at-a-glance view of your remaining capacity with session (5-hour) and weekly (7-day) usage tracking. The app features persistent cookie storage for seamless multi-account management and can automatically wake up sessions when usage resets, ensuring you never miss a beat.
